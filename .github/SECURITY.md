## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities on GitHub. Instead, get the attention of a developer in our [development IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.inspircd.org:+6697/#inspircd.dev) at irc.inspircd.org #inspircd.dev and PM them the details.

We will triage your issue as soon as possible and try to release a fixed version within a week of receiving your report.
