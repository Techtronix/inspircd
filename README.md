### About

InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++ for Linux,
BSD, Windows and Mac OS X systems which was created from scratch to be stable,
modern and lightweight.

As InspIRCd is one of the few IRC servers written from scratch, it avoids a
number of design flaws and performance issues that plague other more established
projects, such as UnrealIRCd, while providing the same level of feature parity.

InspIRCd is one of only a few IRC servers to provide a tunable number of
features through the use of an advanced but well documented module system. By
keeping core functionality to a minimum we hope to increase the stability,
security and speed of InspIRCd while also making it customisable to the needs of
many different users.

This is a fork of the main InspIRCd project, modified and maintained to fit the
needs of Techtronix.
